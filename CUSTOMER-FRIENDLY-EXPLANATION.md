# What We Actually Do: Customer-Friendly Explanation
## Simple, Clear Language for Tax Services & Realtors

---

## üéØ THE ONE-SENTENCE EXPLANATION

**"We make sure that when people ask ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI assistants for recommendations in your industry, YOUR business shows up first - not your competitors."**

---

## ü§î THE PROBLEM (Show Them This)

**Try this right now:**
1. Open ChatGPT
2. Ask: "Who should I use as a realtor in [your city]?"
3. Ask: "Recommend a tax service in [your city]"

**What happens:**
- ‚ùå Your business probably ISN'T mentioned
- ‚úÖ Your competitors ARE mentioned
- üò∞ People are making buying decisions based on these responses

**This is the new search.** More people are asking AI than searching Google.

---

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION (What We Do)

We optimize your **digital footprint** so AI systems recommend YOU. Think of it like this:

### **Traditional SEO** = Make Google show your website
### **GEO (What we do)** = Make AI assistants recommend YOUR business

---

## üîß THE TECHNICAL WORK (Simple Breakdown)

### **PART 1: External Optimization** (70% of our work)
*This requires NO access to your website*

#### What We Actually Do:

**1. Google Business Profile Mastery**
- **What it is:** Your Google Maps listing
- **What we do:** Complete every field, add photos, post updates 2x/week, manage reviews, answer questions
- **Why it matters:** AI assistants pull heavily from Google Maps
- **Your access needed:** Just make us a "manager" (takes 30 seconds)

**2. Directory Domination**
- **What it is:** Your profiles on Yelp, Zillow, Realtor.com, TurboTax, H&R Block directory, etc.
- **What we do:** Claim and optimize 50+ directory listings you didn't know existed
- **Why it matters:** AI reads data from hundreds of sources - we control those sources
- **Your access needed:** None (we do it all)

**3. Review Engine**
- **What it is:** Google reviews, Yelp reviews, industry-specific reviews
- **What we do:** Help you get more reviews, respond to all reviews professionally
- **Why it matters:** AI assistants trust businesses with lots of positive reviews
- **Your access needed:** None (we just need you to ask clients for reviews)

**4. Content Everywhere**
- **What it is:** Articles, Q&A, posts about your expertise
- **What we do:** Write and publish content on LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, Reddit, local blogs
- **Why it matters:** AI finds and cites this content when recommending experts

---

### **PART 2: Technical Website Optimization** (30% of our work)
*This makes your website AI-readable*

#### What We Actually Do:

**1. Allow AI Bots to Read Your Site**
- **What it is:** One file on your website (robots.txt)
- **What we do:** Add 5 lines of code that say "AI bots, please read this site"
- **Why it matters:** Many sites accidentally block AI from reading them
- **Your access needed:** Either edit one file, OR we give your web person the code

**2. Add "Schema Markup" (AI's Reading Guide)**
- **What it is:** Hidden code that tells AI exactly what your business does
- **What we do:** Add structured data like:
  - "Jane Smith is a Realtor in Austin, Texas"
  - "Smith Tax Services specializes in small business taxes"
  - "Phone: XXX, Address: XXX, Hours: XXX"
- **Why it matters:** Makes it EASY for AI to understand your business
- **Your access needed:** Either website login, OR we give your web person code snippets to paste

**3. Optimize Your Content for AI Reading**
- **What it is:** Restructure your web pages
- **What we do:** 
  - Add FAQ sections (AI loves these)
  - Put answers FIRST (then details)
  - Use bullet points, clear headings
  - Add specific data (years in business, certifications, awards)
- **Why it matters:** AI prefers clearly structured information
- **Your access needed:** Website login (optional - we can skip this if needed)

**4. Track AI Bot Visits**
- **What it is:** See when ChatGPT's crawler visits your site
- **What we do:** Monitor which pages AI bots read most
- **Why it matters:** Helps us optimize what's working
- **Your access needed:** Google Analytics access (optional)

## üí¨ CUSTOMER OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "Can't I just do this myself?"
**Answer:** "Absolutely! But it requires:
- Monitoring 5+ AI platforms weekly (2 hours/week)
- Managing 50+ directory listings (10 hours initial setup, 2 hours/month maintenance)
- Writing SEO-optimized content (4-8 hours/month)
- Technical schema implementation (if you know how to code)
- Responding to all reviews professionally (1 hour/week)

**Total: 20-30 hours/month.** Most business owners find their time better spent serving clients and earning $XXX/hour, not learning AI optimization."

---

### "What if I don't have a website?"
**Answer:** "Not a problem! 70% of our work doesn't touch your website. We optimize:
- Your Google Business Profile
- Your directory listings
- Your reviews
- Content we publish about you on other sites

**Many of our most successful clients don't have fancy websites.** AI reads from hundreds of sources - we control those."

---

### "My nephew/web designer handles my website. Will this mess things up?"
**Answer:** "Nope! We work alongside your existing team. For technical work, we either:
1. Get minimal access to add a few code snippets (takes them 30 minutes)
2. Provide them the code and they paste it (they'll understand)
3. Skip the technical stuff entirely and focus on external optimization

**Nothing we do breaks existing websites.** We're adding, not changing."

---

### "How do I know this is working?"
**Answer:** "We send you weekly reports showing:
- Screenshots of YOU appearing in ChatGPT/Claude responses
- Your 'AI Visibility Score' (0-100) improving month-over-month
- Comparison to competitors
- Google Business Profile views/calls/clicks increasing
- Review count growing

**Before/after proof is built into our service.**"

---

### "Why not just hire an SEO agency?"
**Answer:** "Traditional SEO = Rank on Google search results.

**What we do (GEO)** = Appear in AI assistant responses.

**Different game, different rules.**

SEO agencies optimize for Google's algorithm. We optimize for how ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity make recommendations. The strategies are different because the technology is different."

---

## üéì THE "WHY THIS MATTERS" STORY

**Tell customers this:**

"Five years ago, when someone needed a realtor/tax preparer, they:
1. Googled "realtor near me"
2. Clicked through websites
3. Called 3-5 businesses

**Today, people ask AI:**
- 'Who should I use as a realtor in Austin?'
- 'Recommend a good tax preparer for small business'
- 'Is [Your Business Name] any good?'

**And they trust the first answer AI gives them.**

ChatGPT has 200 million weekly users. More than half of Gen Z and Millennials start with AI, not Google.

**If AI doesn't mention you, you don't exist to them.**

That's what we fix."

## ‚úÖ TARGETING TAX SERVICES & REALTORS? YES, PERFECT.

### Why Realtors Are GREAT:
‚úÖ High transaction value ($10K-30K commission per sale)
‚úÖ Can afford $1K-5K/month services  
‚úÖ Competitive market (need edge)
‚úÖ Local service (GEO works best for local)
‚úÖ Already invest in marketing
‚úÖ Tons of them (scalable market)

### Why Tax Services Are GREAT:
‚úÖ High lifetime value (recurring annual clients)
‚úÖ Can afford $1K-5K/month services
‚úÖ Busy season = urgency (Jan-April people need tax help)
‚úÖ Local + specialized (small business taxes, etc.)
‚úÖ Competitive market
‚úÖ Lots of them (CPAs, EAs, tax firms)

### The Best Part:
**Both industries have similar needs:**
- Local service area
- Need to build trust
- Benefit from reviews
- High competition
- Professionals, not corporations

**You can use THE SAME playbook for both.** Just swap out industry-specific directories and content topics.

## üöÄ HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER

**Step 1: Show the Problem**
"Let me show you something. I'm going to ask ChatGPT for [realtor/tax service] recommendations in [city]."

*[Pull up ChatGPT, ask question, show results]*

"See? You're not mentioned. But [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] are. People are making decisions based on this."

---

**Step 2: Explain the Solution (Simply)**
"We fix this by optimizing your digital presence everywhere AI looks:
- Your Google Business Profile
- Review sites like Yelp
- Directory listings (there are 50+ you probably don't know about)
- Content about your expertise

**Think of it like this:** Traditional marketing = billboard on the highway. What we do = make sure the GPS (AI) routes people to YOUR business."

---

**Step 3: Show What We Do**
"Here's what we do every month:
- Update your Google profile 8x (posts, photos, Q&A)
- Optimize 50+ directory listings
- Help you get 5+ new reviews
- Write 4 articles showcasing your expertise
- Track your AI visibility weekly

**You don't lift a finger.** We handle it all."

---

**Step 4: Address Access Concerns**
"We don't need access to your website. We just need:
- Manager access to your Google Business Profile (I'll show you how, takes 30 seconds)
- Basic info: your address, phone, services, a few photos

That's it. We do everything else."

---

**Step 5: Show the Investment & Guarantee**
"$997 per month. We commit for 90 days because that's how long it takes to see meaningful results.

**Here's my guarantee:** If in 90 days you're not seeing yourself appear in AI responses more often, I'll refund your last month.

Can we start next week?"
