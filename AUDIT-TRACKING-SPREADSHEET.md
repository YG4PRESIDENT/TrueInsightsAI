## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Screenshot naming:**

- Keeps everything organized

**Competitor audits:**
- If time allows, do quick check on competitors
- Run same 10 queries, count how often they appear
- Makes your report more compelling

**Reuse template:**
- Create ONE master Google Sheet
- For each new client: File → Make a Copy
- Rename copy with client name
- Fill in their data

**Batch processing:**
- If doing multiple audits, run all ChatGPT queries at once
- Then all Claude queries, etc.
- More efficient than switching platforms per client

**Save screenshots to Google Drive:**
- Create folder: "AI Audits/[Client Name]/Screenshots"
- Easy to insert into Google Doc report later
