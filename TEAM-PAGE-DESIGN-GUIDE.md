## If You Need to Make Further Adjustments

### To change button colors:
Look for the "Connect Button" section in `app/team/page.tsx` (around line 89-96) and modify:
```
from-blue-600 to-purple-600
```

### To adjust spacing:
- Between team members: Change `gap-20` in line 57
- Below profile image: Change `mb-8` in line 67
- Below name: Change `mb-2` in line 77
- Below role: Change `mb-6` in line 80
- Below bio: Change `mb-8` in line 83

### To change profile image size:
Look for line 68 and change `w-40 h-40` to your desired size (e.g., `w-48 h-48` for larger)

### To add actual profile photos:
Replace the gradient circle with an `<img>` tag:
```tsx
<img 
  src={member.image} 
  alt={member.name}
  className="w-40 h-40 rounded-full object-cover shadow-lg"
/>
```
