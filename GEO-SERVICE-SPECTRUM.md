# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Service Spectrum

## Executive Summary
GEO is about controlling your digital presence in AI/LLM responses. The spectrum ranges from **external optimization** (no site access needed) to **deep technical integration** (full platform access). Most value comes from the middle tiers.

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT
**You DON'T always need the keys to the kingdom.** Much of GEO happens OUTSIDE the client's website - in directories, citations, structured data platforms, and content distribution networks that AI models actually train on and reference.

## SERVICE TIER BREAKDOWN

### ðŸ¥‰ BRONZE TIER - External Optimization ($500-1,500/mo)
**Access Needed:** NONE (or minimal read-only)
**Perfect for:** Small businesses, realtors starting out, testing the waters

#### What You Actually Do:

**1. AI Visibility Audit & Monitoring**
- Query 10-20 AI engines weekly (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Bing Copilot)
- Track when/how client appears in responses
- Monitor competitor mentions
- Generate "AI Visibility Score" reports
- Alert client when ranking drops

**2. Citation & Directory Optimization**
- Claim/optimize profiles on 50+ directories that AI models scrape:
  - Google Business Profile (critical!)
  - Bing Places, Apple Business Connect
  - Zillow, Realtor.com (for realtors)
  - Yelp, Yellow Pages, Chamber of Commerce
  - Industry-specific directories
  - Wikipedia (if applicable)
  - Crunchbase, LinkedIn Company Page
- Ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency everywhere
- Add rich descriptions, categories, images to each

**3. Review & Content Syndication**
- Manage/respond to reviews (AI models see these)
- Create/distribute press releases to newswires
- Submit articles to industry publications

**4. Schema Markup Recommendations**

## COMMON CLIENT OBJECTIONS & ANSWERS

**"Can't I just do this myself?"**

**"How do you prove ROI?"**
â†’ "We track AI visibility score (how often you appear), click-throughs from AI platforms (when available), and increases in direct searches for your name. We also monitor before/after rankings for key queries in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc."

**"What if AI changes?"**
â†’ "That's exactly why you need us. We monitor 10+ models, track algorithm changes, and adapt strategies. When GPT-5 launches or a new AI platform emerges, you're covered."
