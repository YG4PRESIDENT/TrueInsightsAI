# What GEO Agencies Actually Do For You
## Simple Explanation for Business Owners

---

## 🎯 THE BIG IDEA (In Plain English)

**When someone asks ChatGPT "Who's the best realtor in Austin?" - you want YOUR name to come up, not your competitor's.**

That's what GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) agencies do. They make sure AI assistants recommend YOUR business when people ask questions.

## 📋 WHAT GEO AGENCIES ACTUALLY DO (Month by Month)

### Month 1: "Make AI Recognize You Exist"

**Week 1: The Discovery**
- They ask AI platforms 50 questions about your industry
- They screenshot everything (you probably won't be mentioned - that's the problem!)
- They check your competitors (they're probably winning)
- They create a "baseline report" showing where you stand

**Week 2: Fix Your Google Business Profile**
- They complete EVERY field (most businesses are only 60% complete)
- They add 20+ photos (AI loves visual content)
- They add all your services with descriptions
- They create posts (2 per week)
- **Result:** Google's AI can now find you

**Week 3-4: Get Your Name Everywhere**
- They claim/optimize 50+ directory listings (Yelp, LinkedIn, industry sites, etc.)
- They make sure your Name, Address, Phone are EXACTLY the same everywhere
- **Why:** AI gets confused if your address is "123 Main St" in one place and "123 Main Street" in another
- **Result:** AI sees you're a real business with consistent information

**Month 1 Deliverable:** 
- Report showing you went from "invisible" to "recognized"
- List of 50+ places your business is now listed
- Before/after screenshots

### Month 2: "Make AI Trust You"

**Content Creation:**
- They write 4-6 blog posts/articles answering common questions
- Example: "How to Choose a Realtor in Austin: 2025 Guide"
- They format it so AI can easily quote it (lists, stats, clear answers)
- **Result:** AI has quotable content to cite

**Reddit & Quora Presence:**
- They post helpful answers on Reddit/Quora mentioning your business (naturally, not spammy)
- **Why:** 35% of AI citations come from Reddit/Quora
- **Result:** Real people talking about you = AI trusts you more

**Press Releases & Media:**
- They write and distribute press releases about your business
- They get you featured in local media, podcasts, articles
- **Result:** More places AI can find you mentioned

**Month 2 Deliverable:**
- 4-6 new content pieces (links to everything)
- Reddit/Quora activity report
- Media mentions report
- Updated visibility scores (you should see improvement!)

---

### Month 3: "Make AI Recommend You First"

**Advanced Content:**
- They create "stats pages" (AI LOVES statistics)
- Example: "Restaurant Industry Statistics 2025" with 20-30 quotable stats
- They add videos (pages with videos get 2X more citations)
- **Result:** AI has authoritative content to cite

**Content Refresh:**
- They update your pages every 2-3 days (AI prefers fresh content)
- They add new stats, quotes, information
- **Result:** Your content stays relevant and cited

**Authority Building:**
- They get you listed in Wikipedia, industry directories, awards
- They build your "digital reputation" across the web
- **Result:** AI sees you as an authority

**Month 3 Deliverable:**

## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

### Avoid Agencies That:
- ❌ **Promise #1 rankings in 30 days** (unrealistic)
- ❌ **Can't show you baseline reports** (how do they know what to fix?)
- ❌ **Charge extra for "add-ons"** (hidden costs)
- ❌ **Don't test multiple AI platforms** (ChatGPT isn't the only one!)
- ❌ **Focus only on your website** (70% of value is external optimization)
- ❌ **Can't explain what they do in simple terms** (if they can't explain it, they don't understand it)
