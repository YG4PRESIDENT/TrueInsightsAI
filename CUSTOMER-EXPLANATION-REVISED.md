# Customer Explanation: What We Actually Do
## Based on Your Understanding - Refined & Ready to Pitch

---

## üéØ THE BIG PICTURE

**"We do Full-Stack Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) - making your business appear first when people ask AI for recommendations."**

**What that means:**
- We handle the monitoring (like AIpeekaboo)
- We implement the technical fixes (like an agency)
- We manage your external presence (like a reputation firm)
- We create AI-optimized content (like a content agency)

**‚Üí One partner for your entire AI presence**

---

## üîë THE KEY INSIGHT

**Getting your business to appear in AI search results ISN'T just about optimizing your website.**

**It's about optimizing the SOURCES that AI uses to form its answers.**

Think about it:
- When ChatGPT recommends a realtor, it doesn't just read one website
- It aggregates data from: Google Maps, Yelp, Reddit, news articles, Zillow, Quora, reviews, directories, etc.
- **We control those sources**

**The breakdown:**
- 70% of your AI visibility = External sources (reviews, directories, Reddit, press)
- 30% of your AI visibility = Your website (schema markup, structure)

**This is why we can deliver massive value even WITHOUT website access.**

---

## üìä THE SPECTRUM: WHAT WE CAN DO

### **WITHOUT "THE KEYS" (No Website Access Needed)**
*This is 70% of the value*

#### **1. Full AI Visibility Audit**
**What we do:**
- Query top AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Bing Copilot)
- Ask 10-20 questions like: "Who's the best [realtor/tax preparer] in [city]?"
- Screenshot all results
- Document: Do you appear? Do competitors appear? Where's the gap?
- Check if your website accidentally blocks AI bots (robots.txt audit)
- Analyze if your website has structured Q&A formats

**Deliverable:** 
- "AI Visibility Score" (0-100) showing current state
- Competitor benchmark
- Gap analysis

**Time:** 4-6 hours (initial)

---

#### **2. Claim/Optimize External Business Profiles**
**What we do:**
- Claim 50-100+ directory listings (depends on industry)
- For each industry, we have a master list of directories AI scrapes:
  - **Everyone:** Google Business Profile, Yelp, BBB, Bing Places, Apple Business Connect, Facebook, LinkedIn
  - **Realtors:** Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia, Redfin, Homes.com
  - **Tax Services:** TurboTax directory, H&R Block Find a Pro, Thumbtack, Expertise.com
- Add rich descriptions (200-500 words each)
- Ensure NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone - EXACTLY the same everywhere)
- Add Q&A format where possible
- Upload photos

**Why this matters:**
AI models pull heavily from these directories. When ChatGPT says "According to Google Maps..." or "Based on Yelp reviews..." - we control that data.

**Deliverable:** 50-100 optimized profiles

**Time:** 15-20 hours (initial setup), 3-5 hours/month (maintenance)

---

#### **3. Google Business Profile Deep Optimization** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
**What we do:**
- Complete EVERY field (categories, services, hours, description, photos, attributes)
- Q&A seeding (ask and answer 10-15 common questions yourself)
- Product/service catalog (detailed listings with prices)
- Regular photo uploads (AI models see these in embeddings)
- Post updates 2-3x/week (new listings, market updates, tips)
- Same process for Bing Places, Apple Business Connect

**Why this matters:**
Google Business Profile is THE #1 source AI models cite for local businesses. This alone can drive 30-40% visibility improvement.

**Deliverable:** 100% completed profile, 8+ posts/month, growing engagement

**Time:** 3-4 hours/week

---

#### **4. Review Accumulation & Management** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
**What we do:**
- Help you get 5-10 new Google reviews per month
- Get reviews on: Yelp, industry-specific platforms (Zillow, etc.)
- Respond professionally to ALL reviews (positive and negative)
- Encourage detailed reviews (AI loves specifics: "Saved me $3,200 in taxes")

**Why this matters:**
AI cites reviews CONSTANTLY: "According to 127 Google reviews, Jane Smith has a 4.9‚òÖ rating and clients praise her negotiation skills..."

Reviews = social proof = AI trusts it

**Deliverable:** 5-10 new reviews/month, 100% response rate

**Time:** 2-3 hours/month

---

#### **5. Max Reddit Marketing** ‚≠ê **UNDERRATED**
**What we do:**
- Answer 5-10 questions per week in relevant subreddits:
  - **Realtors:** r/RealEstate, r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer, r/Austin (city subreddit)
  - **Tax Services:** r/tax, r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur, r/Austin
- Provide genuine value (not spam - Redditors smell BS a mile away)
- Establish you as the expert
- Subtle mentions of your business when relevant

**Why this matters:**
Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) was an early Reddit investor. ChatGPT uses Reddit as a core training and citation source. When AI sees you answering questions as an expert across Reddit, it associates you with expertise.

**Getting sneaky and optimized with Reddit is MASSIVELY underrated for AI visibility.**

**Deliverable:** 20-40 high-quality Reddit answers/month

**Time:** 3-5 hours/week

---

#### **6. External Content Network**
**What we do:**
- Generate off-site AI-optimized content that references your business:
  - Medium posts (2-4/month)
  - Quora answers (5-10/month)
  - LinkedIn articles (2-4/month)
  - Guest posts on industry blogs
  - Local blog microsites (if needed)
- Write in clean, AI-readable format (Q&A structure, schema markup where possible)
- Include expertise indicators (credentials, data, specifics)
- Strategic internal links back to your site (but NOT the primary goal)

**Why this matters:**
This isn't traditional "backlink building" (AI doesn't care about backlinks the way Google does).

This is **citation diversity** - AI sees your expertise mentioned in multiple trusted places. Each piece becomes a "reference node" AI can cite.

When AI sees: Medium article + Quora answer + Reddit post + your website all saying similar things ‚Üí it trusts you're the expert.

**For each industry, we have a systematic content calendar:**
- **Tax:** "2025 tax deductions," "LLC vs S-Corp," "IRS audit triggers"
- **Realtors:** "Best neighborhoods in [city]," "First-time buyer tips," "Market analysis"

**Deliverable:** 8-16 external content pieces/month

**Time:** 8-12 hours/month

---

#### **7. Press & Media Mentions**
**What we do:**
- Submit to HARO (Help a Reporter Out) 5-10x/week
- Pitch local journalists (Austin Business Journal, local TV, podcasts)
- Press release distribution (new milestones, market insights)
- Get quoted in industry publications

**Why this matters:**
When Forbes, local news, or industry blogs quote you, AI sees: "According to John Smith, CPA, quoted in Forbes..."

Media mentions = instant authority

**Deliverable:** 2-5 media mentions per quarter

**Time:** 5-8 hours/month

---

#### **8. Weekly AI Visibility Tracking** (Your Proof of Value)
**What we do:**
- Query 10-20 questions across 5 AI platforms weekly
- Screenshot when you appear
- Track position, competitor mentions
- Calculate "AI Visibility Score" (0-100)
- Monthly reports showing improvement

**Deliverable:** 
- Weekly screenshots
- Monthly reports
- Before/after proof

**Time:** 2-3 hours/week

---

### **TOTAL WITHOUT KEYS:**
**Time:** 40-60 hours/month (full service)
**Impact:** 70% of total AI visibility improvement

---

## üîê WITH "THE KEYS" (Website Access)
*This is the additional 30% of value*

#### **1. Allow/Enable AI Bots to Crawl**
**What we do:**
- Update robots.txt file (one file, 5 lines of code)
- Change from blocking AI to allowing AI:

```txt
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /
```

**Why this matters:**
Many sites accidentally block AI bots. If ChatGPT can't read your site, it can't cite you.

**Deliverable:** Updated robots.txt, verified in Google Search Console

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

#### **2. Add Schema Markup (AI's Reading Guide)**
**What we do:**
Add hidden JSON-LD code that tells AI exactly what your business is:

**Types of schema we add:**
- **LocalBusiness/RealEstateAgent/AccountingService schema** (homepage)
  - Name, address, phone, services, credentials, hours, areas served
- **FAQPage schema** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL - Every service page should have this**
  - "How much does tax prep cost?" ‚Üí Structured answer
  - AI LOVES FAQPage schema - pulls directly into responses
- **Review schema** (display your ratings)
- **Article schema** (blog posts)
- **Person schema** (for individual professionals - your credentials, expertise)

**Example (simplified):**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@type": "AccountingService",
  "name": "Smith Tax Services",
  "description": "CPA-led tax prep for small businesses in Austin",
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "address": "123 Main St, Austin, TX",
  "telephone": "512-555-0100",
  "areaServed": "Austin, Texas",
  "knowsAbout": ["Tax Planning", "Small Business Tax", "IRS Audit Defense"]
}
</script>
```

**Why this matters:**
Schema markup is like a nutrition label for your business. AI reads this FIRST before trying to parse your website copy.

Without schema: AI has to guess what you do
With schema: AI knows exactly what you do, where, and for whom

**Deliverable:** Schema on 5-15 key pages

**Time:** 8-12 hours (initial), 1-2 hours/month (updates)

---

#### **3. Optimize Content Structure for AI**
**What we do:**
- Restructure pages to "answer-first" format
  - Put the answer in the first paragraph (not buried)
  - Then elaborate with details
- Add FAQ sections to EVERY service page
- Use bullet points (AI parses these easily)
- Add clear headings (H1, H2, H3 hierarchy)
- Include specific numbers (years in business, credentials, ratings, prices)
- Add expertise indicators (awards, certifications, client count)

**Before (bad for AI):**
```
"Welcome to Smith Tax Services! We've been proudly serving..."
[5 paragraphs of fluff]
"We offer tax preparation services."
```

**After (good for AI):**
```
"Smith Tax Services is a CPA-led tax firm in Austin, Texas 
specializing in small business tax preparation. We've prepared 
5,000+ returns with an average client refund of $4,200."

Services:
‚Ä¢ Individual Tax Prep ($250+)
‚Ä¢ Small Business Tax ($500+)
‚Ä¢ S-Corp Returns ($1,200+)
‚Ä¢ IRS Audit Defense

FAQ:
Q: How much does tax preparation cost?
A: Individual returns start at $250...
```

**Why this matters:**
AI prefers clearly structured, scannable content. The easier you make it for AI to understand, the more likely it cites you.

**Deliverable:** Optimized content on 5-15 key pages

**Time:** 3-5 hours per page

---

#### **4. Add Interactive Tools (Advanced)**
**What we do:**
- Build calculators/tools on your site:
  - **Tax:** Tax refund estimator, small business savings calculator
  - **Realtors:** Home affordability calculator, mortgage payment calculator
- These become citation magnets (people link, AI references)

**Deliverable:** 1-2 interactive tools

**Time:** 20-40 hours (development)

---

#### **5. Video Content + Transcripts**
**What we do:**
- Record expertise videos (5-10 min each)
- Professional transcription
- Publish transcript on website (AI reads text, not video)
- Add VideoObject schema

**Why this matters:**
Video content with full transcripts = highly citeable

**Deliverable:** 2-4 videos/month with transcripts

**Time:** 4-6 hours per video

---

### **TOTAL WITH KEYS:**
**Additional time:** 15-25 hours/month
**Impact:** Additional 30% of AI visibility

---

## üí° IS IT WORTH IT? IS IT A SELLING POINT?

### **YES on both counts. Here's why:**

**Worth It:**
‚úÖ AI is becoming the primary search tool (ChatGPT has 200M weekly users)
‚úÖ Early movers dominate (you're positioning clients NOW while competitors sleep)
‚úÖ Results compound (each citation, review, mention builds on previous)
‚úÖ Defensible moat (hard for competitors to catch up once you're established)

**Selling Point:**
‚úÖ **"First-mover advantage"** - Most businesses don't even know GEO exists
‚úÖ **"Future-proof your business"** - AI search will only grow
‚úÖ **"One partner for entire AI presence"** - Not just a tool, full service
‚úÖ **"70% of value without website access"** - Low barrier to entry
‚úÖ **Clear proof** - Weekly screenshots showing improvement

---

## üéØ THE PITCH FRAMEWORK

**Problem:**
"When someone asks ChatGPT 'Who's the best [realtor/tax preparer] in [city]?' - you're probably not mentioned. Your competitors are. People are making hiring decisions based on AI recommendations."

**Solution:**
"We do Full-Stack Generative Engine Optimization. We control the sources AI uses - your Google profile, reviews, Reddit discussions, press mentions, directories - everything. Plus optional technical optimization if we have website access."

**Value Prop:**
"We can deliver 70% of results WITHOUT touching your website. Just need manager access to your Google Business Profile. If you give us website access, we can push it to 100%."

**Proof:**
"We track your AI visibility weekly. You'll see screenshots of yourself appearing in ChatGPT/Claude responses. Typical clients see 300-400% improvement in 90 days."

**Investment:**
"$997/month for external optimization (no website access needed). $2,497/month if you want the full technical package. 90-day minimum because that's how long meaningful results take."
