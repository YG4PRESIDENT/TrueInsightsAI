## üîç Framework Question - Answered!

### You Asked: "Am I fucking up by not using Astro?"

**Answer: NO! You made the right choice with Next.js.**

#### Why Next.js is Perfect Here:

1. **Animation Libraries Work Beautifully**
   - Framer Motion integrates seamlessly
   - GSAP works perfectly
   - React ecosystem = more animation options

2. **Component Reusability**
   - Easy to maintain and update
   - DRY code with reusable UI components
   - TypeScript support is excellent

3. **Interactive Features**
   - This landing page has LOTS of interactivity:
     - Tabs
     - Accordions
     - Forms with validation
     - Toggles
     - Mobile menus
   - Next.js makes this easier than Astro

4. **GitHub Pages Works Great**
   - Static export configured ‚úÖ
   - GitHub Actions workflow ready ‚úÖ
   - Auto-deployment on push ‚úÖ

#### When You'd Use Astro Instead:

- Content-heavy sites (blogs, documentation)
- Sites that need ultra-fast initial load (e-commerce)
- Sites with minimal interactivity
- Multi-framework projects (mixing React, Vue, Svelte)

#### For This Project:
**Next.js is the superior choice** because:
- Heavy animation requirements
- Lots of interactive components
- React ecosystem benefits
- Future scalability (can add API routes later if needed)

**You're not messing up - you're using the right tool for the job!** ‚úÖ

## üöÄ GitHub Auto-Deployment - Confirmed!

### Yes, It's Already Set Up!

The workflow I created in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will:

1. **Trigger on push to `main` branch**
2. Install dependencies
3. Build the site (`npm run build`)
4. Export static files to `/out`
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
6. Your site goes live!

### To Enable It:

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repository
# 2. Push your code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Milestone 2: Complete landing page"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [YOUR-GITHUB-REPO-URL]
git push -u origin main

# 3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings:
# - Go to Settings > Pages
# - Source: GitHub Actions
# - Done! It deploys automatically on every push
```

### Custom Domain (TrueInsightsAI.com):
- Add `CNAME` file with your domain
- Configure DNS:
  - A records: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153
  - Or CNAME: [your-username].github.io
- GitHub Pages will handle SSL (free HTTPS)

## üìù Content Placeholders

These need your actual content in Milestone 6:

### Text Placeholders:

- [ ] Hero subheadline
