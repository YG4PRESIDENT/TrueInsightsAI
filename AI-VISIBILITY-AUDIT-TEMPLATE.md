**This is your lead magnet:** Offer free "AI Visibility Audit" to prospects → Show them they're invisible → Sell them your service

**Time to complete:** 30-60 minutes per prospect

**Deliverable:** Professional PDF report showing their current AI visibility

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP AUDIT PROCESS

### **STEP 1: Collect Basic Info (5 minutes)**

Ask prospect:
- Business name
- Website URL
- Industry (Realtor, Tax Service, Lawyer, etc.)
- City/region they serve
- Top 3 competitors (if they know)

---

### **STEP 2: Run AI Queries (20-30 minutes)**

Open 5 platforms in separate tabs:
1. ChatGPT (chatgpt.com)
2. Claude (claude.ai)
3. Perplexity (perplexity.ai)
4. Gemini (gemini.google.com)
5. Bing Copilot (bing.com/chat)

**For each platform, ask these 10 questions:**

#### **For Realtors:**
1. "Who is the best realtor in [City]?"
2. "Recommend a real estate agent in [City], Texas"
3. "Top realtors in [City] for first-time buyers"
4. "Best luxury real estate agent in [City]"
5. "Who should I use to buy a home in [City]?"
6. "Find me a realtor in [City] with good reviews"
7. "Real estate agent recommendations [City]"
8. "Top-rated realtors near [City]"
9. "Who's the most experienced realtor in [City]?"
10. "Best realtor for selling a home in [City]"

#### **For Tax Services / CPAs:**
1. "Who is the best tax preparer in [City]?"
2. "Recommend a CPA for small business in [City]"
3. "Top tax services in [City]"
4. "Best accountant for small business taxes in [City]"
5. "Who should I use for tax preparation in [City]?"
6. "Find me a CPA in [City] with good reviews"
7. "Tax preparation recommendations [City]"
8. "Top-rated tax services near [City]"
9. "Who's the best CPA for S-Corp taxes in [City]?"
10. "Best tax preparer for self-employed in [City]"

#### **Generic Template (Adapt for any industry):**
1. "Who is the best [profession] in [City]?"
2. "Recommend a [profession] in [City]"
3. "Top [profession] in [City]"
4. "Best [profession] in [City] with good reviews"
5. "Who should I use as a [profession] in [City]?"
6. "Find me a [profession] near [City]"
7. "[Profession] recommendations [City]"
8. "Top-rated [profession] near [City]"
9. "Most experienced [profession] in [City]"
10. "Best [profession] for [specific need] in [City]"

---

### **STEP 3: Document Results (As You Go)**

**For each query, record:**

| Platform | Query | Prospect Mentioned? | Position | Competitors Mentioned | Screenshot |
|----------|-------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| ChatGPT | "Best realtor in Austin" | No | - | Jane Doe Realty, Austin Homes Co. | ✓ |
| ChatGPT | "Recommend realtor Austin" | No | - | Jane Doe, John Smith | ✓ |

**Quick recording method:**
- ✅ = Mentioned
- ❌ = Not mentioned
- If mentioned: Note position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or just "mentioned")
- Screenshot EVERY response (you'll need these for the report)

**Pro tip:** Use a simple spreadsheet while you work, transfer to report template after

---

### **STEP 4: Calculate AI Visibility Score (5 minutes)**

**Formula:**
- Total possible mentions: 50 (10 queries × 5 platforms)
- Count how many times prospect was mentioned
- Score = (Mentions / 50) × 100

**Examples:**
- 0 mentions = 0% visibility (common)
- 5 mentions = 10% visibility
- 15 mentions = 30% visibility
- 25 mentions = 50% visibility (good)
- 40+ mentions = 80%+ visibility (excellent, rare)

**Competitor score:**
- Do the same for their top 2 competitors (if you have time)
- Shows them they're being beaten

---

### **STEP 5: Quick Website Check (10 minutes)**

**Check if their website blocks AI bots:**

1. Go to: `theirwebsite.com/robots.txt`
2. Look for these lines:

```txt
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /
```

**If you see "Disallow: /" for AI bots → They're blocking AI** ❌

**If you see "Allow: /" or no mention → They're open to AI** ✅

**Check for structured data:**
1. Go to their homepage
2. Right-click → View Page Source
3. Search for: `@type` (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F)
4. If you find JSON-LD with business info → They have schema ✅
5. If nothing → They don't have schema ❌

**Check for FAQ sections:**
- Do their service pages have FAQ sections? ✅/❌

**This takes 10 minutes and gives you 3 technical findings.**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
           DETAILED AI VISIBILITY ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

We queried 10 common questions across 5 major AI platforms.
Here's what we found:

PLATFORM BREAKDOWN:
┌─────────────┬──────────┬────────────┐
│ Platform    │ Mentions │ Percentage │
├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┤
│ ChatGPT     │  0/10    │    0%      │
│ Claude      │  0/10    │    0%      │
│ Perplexity  │  0/10    │    0%      │
│ Gemini      │  0/10    │    0%      │

├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┤
│ TOTAL       │  0/50    │    0%      │
└─────────────┴──────────┴────────────┘

COMPETITOR COMPARISON:
┌────────────────────┬──────────┬────────────┐
│ Business           │ Mentions │ Visibility │
├────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────┤

│ [Competitor 2]     │  12/50   │    24%     │
│ YOUR BUSINESS      │   0/50   │     0%     │
└────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────┘

WHAT THIS MEANS:
When potential clients ask AI for recommendations, your 
competitors appear 24-30% of the time. You appear 0% of 
the time. You're losing clients to AI recommendations.

### **Page 4: Technical Findings**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
           TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

We analyzed your website's AI-readiness:

1. AI CRAWLER ACCESS (robots.txt)
   Status: ❌ BLOCKING AI CRAWLERS
   
   Finding: Your robots.txt file blocks GPTBot and other 
   AI crawlers. ChatGPT and Claude cannot read your website.
   
   Impact: Even if someone searches for your business name, 
   AI cannot pull information from your site.
   
   Fix: Update robots.txt to allow AI bots (15 minutes)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. STRUCTURED DATA (Schema Markup)
   Status: ❌ MISSING
   
   Finding: Your website lacks schema markup (structured data
   that tells AI what your business does).
   
   Impact: AI has to "guess" what services you offer, your 
   location, credentials, etc. Often gets it wrong or ignores you.
   
   Fix: Add LocalBusiness/RealEstateAgent schema markup

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. AI-FRIENDLY CONTENT FORMAT
   Status: ❌ NOT OPTIMIZED
   
   Finding: Your service pages lack FAQ sections and 
   answer-first formatting that AI prefers.
   
   Impact: Even if AI reads your site, it can't easily extract
   answers to give to users.
   
   Fix: Add FAQ sections, restructure content

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE
   Status: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE (67% complete)
   
   Finding: Your Google Business Profile is missing:
   • Q&A section (0 questions answered)
   • Regular posts (last post: 3 months ago)
   • Service details
   
   Impact: Google Business Profile is the #1 source AI uses
   for local business recommendations. Incomplete = invisible.
   
   Fix: Optimize GBP to 100% completion

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. REVIEW PRESENCE
   Status: ⚠️ LOW
   
   Finding: 
   • Google Reviews: 8 (Competitor avg: 45)
   • Yelp Reviews: 3 (Competitor avg: 22)
   
   Impact: AI heavily cites reviews when making recommendations.
   Low review count = low trust = not recommended.
   
   Fix: Implement review accumulation strategy

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6. DIRECTORY PRESENCE
   Status: ⚠️ LIMITED
   
   Finding: You're listed on 12 directories. Competitors 
   average 45+ directories.
   
   Missing from: Bing Places, Apple Business Connect, 50+ 
   industry-specific directories that AI scrapes.
   
   Impact: AI aggregates data from 100+ sources. Limited 
   presence = limited visibility.
   
   Fix: Claim/optimize 50+ directory listings

### **Page 6: The Opportunity**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
           WHY THIS MATTERS NOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE SHIFT IS HAPPENING:

• ChatGPT has 200+ million weekly users
• 40% of Gen Z/Millennials start with AI, not Google
• AI search is growing 300% year-over-year

MORE PEOPLE ARE ASKING AI FOR RECOMMENDATIONS THAN 
SEARCHING ON GOOGLE.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE:

Right now, most businesses don't know GEO (Generative Engine
Optimization) exists. Your competitors aren't optimizing for AI.

BUT: The ones who ARE optimizing (like [Competitor 1]) are 
capturing all the AI-referred clients.

In 6-12 months, everyone will be doing this. The businesses 
who start NOW will dominate.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOTHING:

Month 1-3:   You continue to lose clients to competitors
             who appear in AI recommendations

Month 4-6:   More competitors start optimizing, making it
             harder to catch up

Month 7-12:  You're permanently behind in AI visibility,
             losing 30-50% of potential clients

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU START NOW:

Month 1:     Technical fixes, foundation laid
Month 2-3:   Start appearing in AI responses (10-20% visibility)
Month 4-6:   Consistent mentions, outranking competitors
             (30-50% visibility)
Month 7-12:  Dominant AI presence, capturing majority of
             AI-referred clients (50-80% visibility)

## 📧 THE EMAIL YOU SEND WITH REPORT

**Subject:** Your AI Visibility Audit Results - [Business Name]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I completed the AI Visibility Audit for [Business Name].

The findings are attached, but here's the quick summary:

• Your AI Visibility Score: [X]%
• [Competitor 1]'s Score: [Y]%
• You're losing clients to AI recommendations

The good news: This is fixable, and you're early. Most 
businesses don't even know AI search optimization exists yet.

I've outlined specific recommendations in the report. The 
critical fixes are:

1. [Top issue from their audit]
2. [Second issue]
3. [Third issue]

Want to discuss how we can help? I have time [Day] at [Time] 
or [Day] at [Time] for a quick 30-minute call.

Just reply with which time works.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I've attached 3 screenshots showing what AI says when 
people ask for [profession] recommendations in [city]. Notice 
who's mentioned and who's not.
```

## 🎯 THE PITCH CALL AFTER THEY READ REPORT

**When they book a call, use this framework:**

**1. Confirm they saw the report (2 min)**
"Did you get a chance to review the audit? Any surprises?"

**2. Expand on the problem (3 min)**
"Just to give you context: ChatGPT has 200 million weekly users now. 
More people are asking AI for [realtor/CPA] recommendations than 
Googling. And right now, [Competitor name] is capturing those clients. 
You're invisible to that entire channel."

**3. Present the solution (5 min)**
"We specialize in Generative Engine Optimization - getting businesses 
to appear first in AI recommendations. We handle three things:

1. Technical fixes (your website, so AI can actually read it)
2. External optimization (Google, directories, reviews - where AI 
   pulls most of its data)
3. Ongoing tracking (so you see yourself climbing in AI results)

Most of our work happens off your website - directories, reviews, 
content - so we don't even need full website access to get started."

**4. Show the path (3 min)**
"Timeline is typically:
- Month 1: Technical foundation, you'll see first mentions
- Month 2-3: Consistent mentions, 20-30% visibility
- Month 4-6: Outrank competitors, 40-60% visibility

We track this weekly, so you see screenshots of yourself appearing 
in ChatGPT responses."

**5. Address objections (5 min)**
- "How much?" → $1,497/month, 3-month minimum
- "Can I do it myself?" → Yes, but 40-60 hrs/month, most business 
  owners don't have time
- "Guarantee?" → We show results in 90 days or refund last month

**6. Close (2 min)**
"Want to move forward? We can start next week. I'll send you the 
agreement, and we'll do an onboarding call to get everything set up."
